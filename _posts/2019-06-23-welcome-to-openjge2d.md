Hey! Welcome to the OpenJGE2D devlogs! This is my first time writing a devlog of any sort, so I’ll try my best to make it interesting. With that being said, a month has flown by since I officially started this project, so I thought it’d be fitting to give a brief update on the state of the engine. Although I haven’t actually begun programming it yet, I’ve dedicated the past four weeks to coming up with a coherent plan for the project’s structure. And after quite a lengthy brainstorming session, I was able to piece together a document outlining a general overview of the engine, and a flowchart detailing it’s architecture, to which I’m just adding a few finishing touches. Also, I should probably mention that, as concrete as I hope my design is, expect some things to change as I continue to work away at it. Don’t worry though, I’ll keep you posted on any changes I make!
Some good news though is that my exams are nearly over, which means I’ll have much more time to spend working on the engine going forward. As of now, I feel that my biggest focus is on improving and organizing the overall project documentation because after all, I’d like this to be as much of a learning experience for others as it is for me, and the best way to do that is by ensuring that everyone can easily access the resources to follow along with development. I’m not too certain on what I’d like the style for this to be, but I know that I want to keep up with writing these devlogs to provide feature/design updates, create a Javadoc for the engine API, and make a simple website to host both these things on. Wow, this is starting to sound like more of an undertaking than the engine itself, haha! Hopefully I can get this all figured out soon though, because I’m excited to start writing the actual code. Anyways, that’s about all I’ve got time for today, but I’ll be sure to write another log soon.

Until next time,

openjge-dev
