So, after another really busy week, I was finally able to piece together the rest of the framework. For now, this just includes the previously completed OpenGL classes as well as a couple new, rudimentary IO classes. It may not seem like much, but this layer will serve as the foundation that all higher level systems will be built off of. Now I can actually start working on the “engine” part of the game engine, so I’m looking forward to that!
I should mention though, that I was able to pull most of the framework code from my previous attempt at making a rendering engine, so this process didn’t require much super intense thinking on my part (which I’m sure the rest of the engine will). Past me was nice enough to leave lots of comments, which made relearning what each class did exactly much easier. This also means that there is already somewhat of a preexisting basis for a few of the systems I’ll be implementing, although I do plan on rearchitecting much of what I did before.
I’m probably going to start working on the Core module and some of the Engine Library classes/interfaces next, and then I can build all the remaining modules around that. I’ll keep you posted on how this goes.
