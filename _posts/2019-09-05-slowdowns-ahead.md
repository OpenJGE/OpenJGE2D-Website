So, yesterday was the first day back to school for me, and I wanted to talk about what that means with regards to the ongoing engine development. If you read the previous devlog, you might’ve been thinking to yourself, “Hmm… the Graphics module seems a bit rushed,” (then again, you might not have been thinking that at all lol) to which I’d reply, “Yes, it is.'' And, as I’m sure you can guess based on when I wrote that last devlog and the topic of this devlog, that reason was due to the looming school year. Now, I’d normally dedicate a sizeable amount of time to the engine as I’ve done in the past with other projects, sometimes to the detriment of my grades. However, I’m now into my final year of highschool, which means that marks matter for getting into the program of my choice at a good university. And good marks require hard work, much more so than previous years. That’s not to say that I’m going to completely stop development though, because I wouldn’t want that to happen. Just expect things to slow down. It may take a bit of time for me to figure out a balance between getting my homework done and studying, working on this project, and dedicating my time to other interests, but don’t worry; I’ll still be here trying to add features and fixes to the engine. That’s about all I have time for today, but I’ll keep you updated on my progress.
