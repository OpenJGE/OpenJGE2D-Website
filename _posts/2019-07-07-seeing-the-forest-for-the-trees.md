This past week has been somewhat of a whirlwind of development… but not on the things I would’ve most liked it to have been on. Rather than working on the actual engine, I focused all of my time on putting this website together (which took a bit longer than expected), and hope to have it in a deployable state by the end of today. This included setting up and figuring out how to use Jekyll, creating site logos, and writing all the initial content. That’s not to say that this website isn’t important though, because it is, and one of the goals I set out to accomplish when starting this project was to provide solid documentation; enough that others could follow along with development and learn how to make their own game engine. But was it a good idea to focus solely on the website as opposed to taking a more balanced approach? Maybe not, although I am glad that I’ve finally gotten this site out of the way and get back into developing the engine. It’s easy to get caught up in other things and lose focus of your original goals, which I struggled with a bit over the past couple days. I suppose it was a case of “not seeing the forest for the trees”, as I tried to avoid getting sidetracked by the trivial details of making a website.

It seems like this post has turned into more of a reflection rather than a clear development update, so I’ll leave you with this: I’ve finished writing all of the framework-level OpenGL classes and hope to complete the rest of the framework over the next couple days, since once that’s done I can start working on the heart of the engine. As for the website, once I’m happy with it I’ll deploy it on Github Pages, and then maybeee show it to people. But that’s only if I’m feeling up to it lol.
