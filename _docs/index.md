## Getting started

Because the engine is still heavily under development, there isn't much to talk about here regarding getting started with using OpenJGE2D. With that being said, if you're curious, feel free to check out the engine source code [here](https://github.com/OpenJGE/OpenJGE2D).

## Navigating The Site

### Docs

The Docs section includes all formal project documentation, including documents detailing engine design, usage guides, and the engine's API.

### Learning Resources

The Learning Resources section contains a collection of resources that can be used to learn about making a game engine from start to finish. This will include my own work, as well as links to articles and websites that do a much better job at explaining topics than I could ever attempt to.

### Blog

The Blog is your way to keep up with OpenJGE2D's development, as well as to see how the project has progressed since its creation. I'll generally write logs to announce, discuss, or reflect on notable events during development, so there isn't a structured schedule for logs, although I will try to write them as frequently as possible. The Blog is also a great way to learn more about the day-to-day work that goes into actually making a game engine (although I can't promise you it's the *right* way to make an engine), and thus serves as a bit of a combination of both documentation and learning resources.
