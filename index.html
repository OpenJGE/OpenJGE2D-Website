              <p class="lead">OpenJGE2D is a free and open source game engine,
              written entirely in Java and built off of <a href="https://lwjgl.org">LWJGL</a>.
              Access to both low-level frameworks and high-level abstractions
              makes OpenJGE2D a competent yet easy to use 2D gamemaking tool.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Modular Design</h3>
            <p> Built from the ground up with a modular design in mind,
              OpenJGE2D leverages flexibility by allowing for the
              implementation of user defined modules. In addition to the
              engine's core set of modules, developers are free to package up
              behaviour, state, and function specific to their games into
              modules that can interact directly with the engine runtime.

            <h3 class="text-center">A Work in  Progress</h3>
            <p>It should be said that while much of the planning has already
            been done, OpenJGE2D is still, for the most part, under
            construction. So, be prepared to see designs change as the engine
            evolves over time.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Meticulous Documentation</h3>
            <p>With a focus on what goes into making a game engine, the
              OpenJGE2D documentation serves to provide people with a way to
              learn about the project's innerworkings in an easy to understand
              manner. And the included devlogs make it straight forward to
              follow along with development as it progresses.</p>
